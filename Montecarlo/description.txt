This Monte-Carlo aims to follow the Compton laboratory experiment at the University of Pisa, where students are asked to verify the Compton scattering theory through the use of the provided apparatus.

Students are given an active source of Co-60, which emits two photons at 1173.240, 1332.508 keV. These photons travel through a cylindrical lead collimator, until they exit the shielding and scatter onto a Carbon plastic scintillator target, with a rectangular prism geometry. From this, they travel forwards until they are collected by a cylindrical crystal NaI detector, where they deposit their energy through Compton and Photoelectric effects. The measured signal is proportional to the deposited energy, and the crystal detector can be rotated about an axis to explore the energy dependence by the scattering angle.

For this simulation, the center of the rotating arm will be taken as the origin of the three-dimensional axes. The forward z direction will point from this center towards the flight direction of the photons exiting the collimator, the x direction will point upwards and represent the axis of rotation for the crystal detector, while the positive y direction will be on the table pointing "right" as to make an orthonormal right - handed coordinate system. Phi will be the angle described by the arm with the positive z direction.

Disclaimer: This Monte-Carlo simulation will only aim to follow what is possible in this laboratory experiment, and for simplicity the only rotations that will be handled are those occurring in the y-z plane, the plane of the table. Attempting to change the x-coordinate of any detector could possibly cause for the simulation to not represent the physics of the system.
